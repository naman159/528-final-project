L1 & R1 contain the left and right sensor data from a 3x8 set of shoulder press (3 sets of 8 reps). The black rubber matt below the sensors gave us noisy and hard to classify sensor data.

For L2 & R2 I instead put a shiny blue crash pad below the sensors and it gave a much more consistent and accurate distance reading. I then performed the same 3x8 shoulder press exercise.
